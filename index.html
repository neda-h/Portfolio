                Before you head out the door, it's always a good idea to check
                the weather. There's nothing worse than putting on something
                nice, like a box-fresh pair of sneakers, only to have it rain or
                snow later and potentially damage your gear. Mobile weather apps
                provide easy access to forecasts whenever you need them. Many
                apps tell you the high temperature for the day, and they give
                you an hour-by-hour breakdown of temperatures, precipitation
                levels and more to keep you informed. These apps can be helpful,
                but many also collect and distribute your data, which could pose
                a danger to your privacy.That's why it's important to understand
                their privacy policies, too.
